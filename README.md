## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used for this task is:

🔗 [Task 4 - Social Media Sentiment Dataset](https://github.com/Prodigy-InfoTech/data-science-datasets/tree/main/Task%204)

The dataset contains social media posts along with sentiment labels such as:

- Positive
- Negative
- Neutral

These sentiments help analyze public perception towards specific subjects or brands.

## 🔎 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing

- Loaded the dataset
- Checked for missing values and duplicates
- Cleaned text data (removed special characters, stopwords, etc.)
- Tokenization and text normalization

### 2️⃣ Sentiment Analysis

- Analyzed sentiment distribution
- Applied sentiment classification (if model implemented)
- Extracted insights from sentiment patterns

### 3️⃣ Data Visualization

- Bar chart of sentiment distribution
- Pie chart representation
- WordCloud for frequently used words
- Trend analysis (if time-based data available)
